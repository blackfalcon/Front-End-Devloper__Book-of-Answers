# Let's be real here ...

In reading more and more of these questions, I am finding some questions where there is some historical significance or relative importance to the over-all community, but knowing the answers to these colloquial questions does not, in any way, establish your personal creditability or skill level as a front-end developer.

I would also argue that some of these questions should be removed from this list all together. So, if interested, read on. If not, ignore and get onto the more important things in life.

#### What's the difference between full standards mode, almost standards mode and quirks mode?
When you look something up and the MDN reference starts out with `In the old days of the web ...` most people drop off there. I fully answered the [doctype](html/doctype.md) question as there is actual functional support for this and it still plays a role with web development. But this historical reference to antiquated rendering types and doctype formats is not worth repeating in this book.

#### What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?
This question falls into the same category as the previous one. XHTML was a standard proposed by the W3C years ago to try and establish a new HTML spec based on the concepts of XML. The only good that came of this is that we no longer are using capitol letters for element names. Other than that, moving on ... nothing to see here folks.

#### Are there any problems with serving pages as `application/xhtml+xml`?
This is yet another question that has its roots in legacy web development and the movement to move to a more XML style spec. From what I understand, this MIME type was an issue in the early days of XHTML and legacy versions of Internet Explorer and Opera. Again, we have so moved on from these issues, Internet Explorer has been 'end of life' and Opera us using Google's BLINK rendering engine.

I have not personally run into this issue in 10+ years, so any any real mental reference to this issue is long gone and Google searches link to articles written in the 'old days' of the web.
