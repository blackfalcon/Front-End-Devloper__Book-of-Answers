# Let's be real here ...

In reading more and more of these questions, I am finding some questions where there is some historical significance or relative importance to the over-all community, but knowing the answers to these colloquial questions does not, in any way, establish your personal creditability or skill level as a front-end developer.

I would also argue that some of these questions should be removed from this list all together. So, if interested, read on. If not, ignore and get onto the more important things in life.
