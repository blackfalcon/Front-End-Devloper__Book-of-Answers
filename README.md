# Front-End Developer Questions: The Book of Answers!

So, whether you are new to web development or an old skool hax0r, you have probably heard of [h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions#js-questions). If not, get over there and take a look!

The next question is, "Where are the answers?" That's a GREAT question, and you will not like the answer üôÅ. The answers are "on the Internet (Stack Overflow)" O_O That sucks! Yup, that totally sucks. What has failed me about this project is that the authors of the questions are not required to give an answer. I am sure that there is a thread in the version history notes, but wow, that's hard. So, great, this is an awesome resource for how to grill a new dev and try to draw some kind of consensus around what questions to ask, we all know that part of the answer is, "It depends!" So that leaves the interviewer WAY TOO MUCH power IMHO.

## Enter, The Book!

That's right, Front-End Developer Questions, the book of answers. And just like the questions, the intent is to keep this open source to garner public inclusion to help those who need to interview, as well as learn (being interviewed).
